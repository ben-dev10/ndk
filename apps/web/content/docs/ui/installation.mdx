Most of the components and tools offered by this library can be obtained through the registry or the `ndk` npm packages.

## Using the `ndk` registry

The simplest way is through the copy-paste method popularized by shadcn/ui. Simply copy and paste component source files from their doc pages or use an automated approach with the shadcn/cli.

If you are using shadcn components in your project, you will have to make some edits to the `components.json` file first before you can use the shadcn/cli. However you can still use the cli to fetch resources
from the registry even if you don't use shadcn/ui components, but in this case you'd still have to create a `components.json` file in the root of your project - this is the only requirement by the shadcn/cli.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json title="components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "src/index.css",
    "baseColor": "neutral",
    "cssVariables": true,
    "prefix": ""
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/components/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks" 
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide",
  "registries": { // [!code ++] 
    "@ndk": "https://ndk-ui.vercel.app/r/{name}.json" // [!code ++] [!code highlight]
  } // [!code ++] 
}
```

When done, you can fetch a resource using this command:

```npm
npx shadcn@latest add @ndk/<resource-name>
```

Example of `<resource-name>`s (they are provided under the installation sections of the doc pages of every component):

- components-basic-stylesheets
- hooks-acme-logo
- hooks-use-open

## Using the `ndk` packages

Before we get started, make sure you have a `react` app ready with `tailwindcss` configured.

    <div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

    ### Install packages
        ```npm
        npm install @_ndk/ui @_ndk/motion
        ```
    ### Import core styles to your globals.css (@_ndk/ui)
        ```css title="globals.css"
        @import "tailwindcss";

        /* main stylesheets */
        @import "@_ndk/ui/tokens";
        @import "@_ndk/ui/themes/neutral.css";

        /* modules */
        @import "@_ndk/ui/fonts";
        @import "@_ndk/ui/typography";

        /* rest of styles */
        ```
    <Callout title="The order of imports matter" type='info' className="mt-4">
         If you don't want the `themes` import interfering with yours, move it above your theme imports, but if you want it to be the main theme for your entire app
         move it further below all imports. Note that without the `theme` import, the components provided by the library won't be styled.
    </Callout>



    ### Animate your elements with "motion-wrappers" (@_ndk/motion)
        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        <MotionStagger preset="blurIn" once={true} staggerDelay={0.5}>
            <div className="text-muted-foreground">
                Test out these components from the library.
            </div>
        </MotionStagger>
        ```

    ### Explore
    These are the main features for the time being. You can now use pre-styled shadcn components from the library if you prefer - no need for a local shadcn setup. The components work and behave
    just like the originals, the only caveat being the source is no more available for modifications.

    Aside this, there are familiar utilities you can import: `cn.ts`, css theme-files, react hooks (`use-mobile`,`use-platform`) .etc with more utilities to be added soon. I intend for this to be
    a consolidation of a myriad of tools and components.
