The documentation on this page is about the package installation process (or the toolkit in general). You can skip ahead if you aren't interested.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have a `react` app ready with `tailwindcss` configured.

<section id="setup-section">
    <div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

    ### Install packages
        ```npm
        npm install @_ndk/ui @_ndk/motion
        ```
    ### Import core styles to your globals.css (@_ndk/ui)
        ```css title="globals.css"
        @import "tailwindcss";

        /* main stylesheets */
        @import "@_ndk/ui/tokens";
        @import "@_ndk/ui/themes/neutral.css";

        /* modules */
        @import "@_ndk/ui/fonts";
        @import "@_ndk/ui/typography";

        /* rest of styles */
        ```
    <Callout title="The order of imports matter" type='info' className="mt-4">
         If you don't want the `themes` import interfering with yours, move it above your theme imports, but if you want it to be the main theme for your entire app
         move it further below all imports. Note that without the `theme` import, the components provided by the library won't be styled.
    </Callout>



    ### Animate your elements with "motion-wrappers" (@_ndk/motion)
        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        <MotionStagger preset="blurIn" once={true} staggerDelay={0.5}>
            <div className="text-muted-foreground">
                Test out these components from the library.
            </div>
        </MotionStagger>
        ```

    ### Explore
    These are the main features for the time being. You can now use pre-styled shadcn components from the library if you prefer - no need for a local shadcn setup. The components work and behave
    just like the originals, the only caveat being the source is no more available for modifications.

    Aside this, there are familiar utilities you can import: `cn.ts`, css theme-files, react hooks (`use-mobile`,`use-platform`) .etc with more utilities to be added soon. I intend for this to be
    a consolidation of a myriad of tools and components.
