## Definition and Usage

The `Background` component attaches itself to the background of a component where background assets like images, and non-interactive graphical elements are meant to be placed.

## Preview

<ComponentPreview
  name="demo-components-background"
  title="background-demo.tsx"
/>

Summary of features:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<div className="ml-8">
  - It is composed of 4 complementary layers: `Background.Img`, `Background.Gradient`, `Background.Texture` and `Background.Layer` that can be used in any
    variation to easily compose unique backgrounds.
  - The main `Background` component is absolutely positioned with `inset-0`, and so it requires its parent to be relatively positioned.
  - All components have `pointer-events` set to none so they don't interfere or overlap with the main contents.
</div>
