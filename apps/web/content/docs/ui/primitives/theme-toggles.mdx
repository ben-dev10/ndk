## Preview

<ComponentPreview
  name="demo-components-theme-toggles"
  title="theme-toggles-demo.tsx"
/>

These components work by toggling `next-themes`'s "light" and "dark" values on click. For this to work, make sure you've already installed `next-themes` and wrapped your root component with the `themes-provider`.

## Installation

<ComponentInstallation name="components-theme-toggles" />

## Usage

```tsx title="theme-toggles-usage.tsx"
<ThemeToggle size={16} className="border-border shrink-0" />
<ButtonGroupThemeToggle />
<DropdownThemeToggle />
```
