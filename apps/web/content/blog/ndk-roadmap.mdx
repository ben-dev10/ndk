Shadcn's meteoric rise over the past few years pioneered a new way of sharing UI code, one that favors direct source-code copy-paste over heavy abstractions or opaque component libraries.
This approach resonated strongly with developers and led to an influx of projects that uphold and extend the same philosophy, with new ones appearing almost daily.

This project follows that tradition, but with a different focus and offering. Most Shadcn-inspired projects tend to emphasize complex components and advanced implementations,
while paying relatively little attention to fundamentals, the small but essential pieces such as theme toggles, social icons, and similar utilities that developers end up rebuilding for nearly every new project.

I built this project to solve those small yet fundamental pain points common to web applications, while also providing a collection of reusable UI blocks (and UI clones, essentially)
inspired by popular apps and projects across the web.

## Roadmap
